        <h1>The One With The Sleeping Skills</h1>
        <p>Alison is a sophomore currently trying to get out of the hellhole known as Liberal Studies and into Tandon for the major Integrated Digital Media. Her super secret power is she can sleep for 12-17 hours at a time and will probably win by not leaving her apartment for days. She wants to win because she wants to be able to finally show off a success to her parents...(Just kidding.)</p>

        <h1>The One With The Sense Of Direction</h1>
        <p>Erin is a Global Liberal Studies major from Burlington, Vermont. She loves to read and bake and go to parks. Her secret talent is that she can ski really fast and can find her way home without GoogleMaps or a phone. (Faster than Gabby can run, and Gabby runs really fast.) She plans on winning for the glory. </p>

        <h1>The One With The Speed</h1>
        <p>Gabby is a sophomore majoring in Global Liberal Studies (with a concentration in Politics, Rights, and Development) and minoring in Food Studies. Because her dad was in the military, Gabby moved around a lot before settling down in Northern Virginia, or “NoVa.” When she’s not in class or writing for WSN, you can find her going on a run, watching food videos or trying to make a quesadilla without burning it. Follow her on Twitter @lozanogabby if you want to see retweeted pictures of pugs and all things Mamma Mia.</p>

        <h1>The One With The Jokes</h1>
        <p>Hailey is a sophomore studying history at the College of Arts and Science. She is an aspiring tik tok star and has an amazing twitter. Her favorite color is black and her favorite food is is banana bread with chocolate chips. She was the brains of the entire TAG operation and has all the mad genius ideas. She wants to win for the fame and glory and to secretly put it on her resume once she makes her LinkedIn and also to relive her high school glory of being a student athlete.</p>

        <h1>The One With The Investigation Skills</h1>
        <p>Lisa Cochran is a sophomore studying Journalism and the Politics concentration within GLS. She is originally from Ames, Iowa — which is more of a vague concept than a real geographical location. When she is not hunched over her or someone else’s WSN article at 2 a.m., she is probably reading literature about being sad, (wastefully) using Nespresso pods at a rate of 3 pods per hour, incessantly rating movies on LetterBoxd or absurdly overdressing for everyday occasions. She is super edgy... meaning she is always on edge. Follow her on Twitter for more shocking details @lisaacochran.</p>

        <h1>The One With The Tricks</h1>
        <p>Soraya is studying Global Liberal Studies and plans to study abroad her junior year. Her secret super power is hypnotism. Soraya is an Instagram famous star and has a numerous amount of connections which will help her win the giant game of tag. </p>
